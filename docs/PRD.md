## 6. Risks & Considerations

- **Complexity in Managing Daily Lists:**  
  Sync between main task items and daily selections in sidebar requires careful state handling.

- **UI Responsiveness:**  
  Sidebar with many interactive elements plus card grid needs good responsive design.

- **Collapsible Sections Usability:**  
  Avoid confusion by clear visual clues and smooth animations.

## 7. Summary

The wireframe presents a robust layout combining a clean, categorized task board with a powerful sidebar focused on daily task focus, daily reflections, and statistics. The addition of collapsible areas for stats and reflections helps keep the sidebar concise while offering rich functionality. Task grouping and tag filtering enhance task organization while the "New Task" modal provides easy task creation.

If you agree with these refinements, we can proceed to design and implement the sidebar components first (daily tasks, statistics, reflections) or the main task list page‚Äîjust let me know your preference! üòäüöÄ
