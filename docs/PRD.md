![wireframe](wireframe.png)

## 1. Overview

Kedhep is a category-based task management system designed to help users quickly regain focus and clarity amidst a sea of tasks. The name "Kedhep" comes from the Javanese word for "winking"â€”the idea is that with just a glance (or a wink) at the screen, you can instantly see all your tasks and easily choose which ones to focus on today.

This app was born out of a real personal need: as someone with many responsibilities and projects, it's easy to feel overwhelmed, lose track, and end up not finishing important work. Kedhep solves this by consolidating all your categorized tasks into one clear interface, making it effortless to:
- See everything you need to do
- Select your daily priorities
- Track your progress
- Reflect on your productivity

By providing an intuitive sidebar with task checkboxes, live statistics, and personal reflections, Kedhep offers a seamless, efficient workload overview and daily planning experience. It's designed for anyone who wants to streamline task management and boost productivity on a single screenâ€”especially those who, like the creator, have struggled with task overload and confusion.
