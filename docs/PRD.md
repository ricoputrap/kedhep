## 5. Database Schema
![db schema](db-schema.png)
### 5.1 Tables
| Table Name       | Description                                           |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| `USER`           | Stores user information (id, name, email, etc.)       |
| `TASK_LIST`      | Stores task lists (id, title, user_id)                |
| `TASK`           | Stores individual tasks (id, title, completed, list_id) |
| `TAG`            | Stores tags (id, name)                                |
| `TASK_LIST_TAG`  | Junction table for many-to-many relationship between `TASK_LIST` and `TAG` |
| `DAILY_TASK`     | Stores daily tasks (id, task_id, date, completed)     |
| `REFLECTION`     | Stores daily reflections (id, user_id, date, content) |

### 5.2 Relationships
- `USER` has many `TASK_LIST`
- `TASK_LIST` has many `TASK`
- `TASK_LIST` has many `TAG` through `TASK_LIST_TAG`
- `TASK` can be part of many `DAILY_TASK`
- `USER` has many `REFLECTION`

### 5.3 Data Flow
- **Task Creation**: New tasks are created in `TASK_LIST` and `TASK`, with optional tags in `TAG` and `TASK_LIST_TAG`.
- **Daily Tasks**: When a task is added to the daily list, it creates an entry in `DAILY_TASK` with the date and completion status.
- **Reflections**: Daily reflections are stored in `REFLECTION`, linked to the user and date.
- **Statistics**: Calculated from `DAILY_TASK` for Todo/Completed counts.
- **Tag Filtering**: Uses `TASK_LIST_TAG` to filter task lists by selected tags.
- **Task Completion**: Updates `completed` status in both `TASK` and `DAILY_TASK` tables.
- **Task Removal**: Deleting a task from the daily list removes the entry from `DAILY_TASK`, but does not delete the task itself from `TASK`.
- **Task List Deletion**: Deleting a `TASK_LIST` removes all associated `TASK` and `TASK_LIST_TAG` entries.
- **Reflection Management**: Each user can have one reflection per day, stored in `REFLECTION` with a unique date.
- **User Management**: All tasks, lists, and reflections are linked to a specific user via `user_id`.
- **Tag Management**: Tags can be created and associated with task lists, allowing for flexible categorization.
- **Statistics Calculation**: The app calculates statistics based on the `DAILY_TASK` entries for the current day, showing counts of completed and pending tasks.

## 6. Technical Enhancements from Wireframe

| Aspect                         | Wireframe Insight                                    | Implementation Details                                   |
|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|

## 7. Development Priorities Based on Wireframe

| Feature                      | Priority | Notes                                             |
|------------------------------|----------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Sidebar with Daily Task List  | High     | Day navigation, checkboxes, removal, task grouping |
| Collapsible Stats & Reflection| Medium   | Collapsible sections with accurate data and save   |
| Task Cards Grid & Filters     | High     | Category grouping, multi-tag filter chips          |
| New Task Modal               | High     | Create tasks with filtering tags                  |
| Navigation Sidebar           | Medium   | Basic navigation for Tasks, Notes, Profile         |

## 8. Risks & Considerations

- **Complexity in Managing Daily Lists:**
  - Must sync between `TASK`, `TASK_LIST`, and `DAILY_TASK` for accurate daily view.
- **UI Responsiveness:**
  - Sidebar and grid must adapt to various screen sizes and overflow scenarios.
- **Collapsible Sections Usability:**
  - Use clear visual cues and smooth animation for collapsible panels.
- **Data Consistency:**
  - Ensure updates to tasks/lists/tags reflect across all relevant UI and DB tables.

---

## 9. Summary

The wireframe and schema together define a robust, category-based task management system with a focus on daily productivity, statistics, and reflection. The sidebar and main content are tightly integrated, and all features are mapped to clear DB structures. The UI is designed for clarity, speed, and flexibility, supporting both power users and casual task managers.

If you agree with these refinements, we can proceed to design and implement the sidebar components first (daily tasks, statistics, reflections) or the main task list page‚Äîjust let me know your preference! üòäüöÄ
