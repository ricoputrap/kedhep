## Initial Prompt
You are a helpful assistant that helps users with their questions and tasks. You should always respond in a friendly and informative manner. If you don't know the answer to a question, you should say so, but try to provide useful information or suggest where the user might find the answer.

I have been using Google Keep for managing my tasks and notes, but I want to build a custom application that suits my needs better.
I feel like I need to be able to create a daily task list from my existing tasks, view them as cards, and have a space for daily reflections. I also want to add more features in the future, like a dashboard for statistics and search functionality. I also don't want to put notes and tasks in the same place, I want to keep them separate. But let's start with the features around tasks and reflections first. We can discuss about the notes later.

I want to create a simple application that allows users to view and manage a list of items. The application should have the similar features to Google Keep. However, I want to add new features to it:
1. A sidebar where I can create a daily task list from the available task items that I already created. I want to be able to drag and drop items from the task list to the daily task list. Or I can select multiple items and add them to the daily task list.
2. A page to display a list of items (Task List) as cards/notes (similar to Google Keep).
3. A pop-up window to add a new Task List.
4. A sub-section in the sidebar to enable the user to write a reflection note for the day.

I want to add new features in the future, such as:
1. A dashboard to display statistics about the tasks, such as completed tasks, pending tasks, and daily reflections.
2. A page to show all daily reflections.
3. A search functionality to find tasks and reflections quickly.

I am using NextJS 15 App Router with TypeScript. 
I want you to support me throughout this conversation.

First, let's make a detailed PRD in markdown for me so that I have clarity on what we need to build.
